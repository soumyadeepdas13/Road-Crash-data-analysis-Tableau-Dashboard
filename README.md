 🎯 Project Purpose

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of UK road accident statistics**, supporting data-driven decision-making in road safety. It helps:

* Monitor **year-over-year road safety performance**
* Identify **high-risk factors** driving accidents
* Understand **casualty patterns** by severity
* Evaluate the role of **weather & road conditions**
* Pinpoint **geographic hotspots** for intervention
* Support **policy planning & resource allocation**

---

 🧩 Key Features

 1️⃣ Multi-Dimensional Casualty Analysis

The dashboard includes five casualty categories:

* **Fatal Casualties**
* **Serious Casualties**
* **Slight Casualties**
* **Total Casualties**
* **Total Accidents**

---

2️⃣ Temporal Trends

* Monthly accident distribution (seasonality trends)
* YoY comparison (2021 vs 2022)
* Clear percentage change indicators
* Trend lines for each severity category

---

 3️⃣ Vehicle Type Analysis

Breakdown of fatal casualties by vehicle types:

* Cars
* Vans
* Motorcycles
* Buses
* Trucks
* Agricultural Vehicles

Includes:
✔ Visual icons
✔ Percentage change metrics
✔ Performance shifts compared to previous year

---

4️⃣ Environmental Impact Assessment

Analyzes how external factors influence accidents:

* Weather conditions
* Road surface conditions (Dry, Wet/Damp, Flooded)
* Pie charts showing proportional distribution of casualties

Key Insight:

> Majority of fatal accidents occurred in good weather, challenging common assumptions.

---

 5️⃣ **Road Infrastructure Analysis**

Horizontal bar chart showing fatal casualties by road type:

* Single carriageways
* Dual carriageways
* Roundabouts
* Slip roads
* One-way streets

Identifies which road types pose the **highest risk**.

---

6️⃣ **Geographic Distribution**

Interactive UK map featuring:

* Exact accident locations
* Pin markers for severity
* Hotspot clustering
* Regional labels (Highlands, Orkney Islands, Western Isles, etc.)

---

 🕹️ Interactive Controls

* **Accident Severity Filter** (Fatal, Serious, Slight, All)
* **Year Selector** (2021 vs 2022)
* Real-time dynamic visual updates

---

 📊 Key Performance Indicators (2022)

 **Overall Performance**

| Metric               | Value   | YoY Change   |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| **Total Accidents**  | 144,419 | ⬇ **11.70%** |
| **Total Casualties** | 195,737 | ⬇ **11.89%** |

---

 **By Severity**

* **Fatal**: 2,855 (⬇ **26.40%**)
* **Serious**: 27,045 (⬇ **16.30%**)
* **Slight**: 165,837 (⬇ **10.82%**)

---

**Vehicle Type Insights**

* **Cars**: Highest number of fatal casualties (2,350) but **23.03% improvement**
* **Motorcycles**: Best improvement with **46.99% reduction**
* **Trucks**: **50% increase** — major concern

---

 **Environmental Observations**

* **85.01%** of fatal casualties happened in *fine weather*
* **67.60%** occurred on *dry roads*

---

**Infrastructure Impact**

* **Single carriageways** → 2,113 fatal casualties (≈ 74%)
* **Dual carriageways** → 677 fatal casualties (much safer comparatively)

---

 🛠️ Practical Use Cases

* **Safety Campaign Planning**
* **Infrastructure Investment Decisions**
* **Seasonal Resource Allocation**
* **Evaluating Policy Effectiveness**
* **Risk Assessment Modelling**

---

 ⚠️ Data Quality & Limitations

* Based on officially reported incidents
* Minor, unreported accidents may be missing
* Accuracy of geographic coordinates depends on reporting sources
* Weather/road conditions reflect the time of the incident
* Best suited for strategic analysis, not real-time operations

---

💡 Value Proposition

This dashboard transforms raw accident data into **actionable safety insights**.
It enables stakeholders to:

* Detect hidden patterns
* Measure intervention effectiveness
* Move from *reactive* to *proactive* safety management

The positive YoY improvement highlights the success of existing policies, while the increase in truck-related casualties reveals emerging risks that require immediate focus.
